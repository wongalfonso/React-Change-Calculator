# React Change Calculator 

This is a simple caclutor that will take in the total amount due and total amound received and calculate the amount that is needed to be returned. The idea behind this calculator is based on a Point Of Sale where the cashier enters the amount of the sale and the amount received for the purchase. The amount is then spit out wether the customer owes or will receive change.
